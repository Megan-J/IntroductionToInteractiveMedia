# Midterm Remix with Arduino

### Project Description

I modified my midterm project to combine the code of that project with an Arduino Uno. I knew from the beginning of this project that I wanted to use the Ultrasonic Sensor but I did not know how the sensor worked. I learned all about the sensor and its functions from [Jeremy S. Cook's article](https://www.arrow.com/en/research-and-events/articles/ultrasonic-sensors-how-they-work-and-how-to-use-them-with-arduino#:~:text=Ultrasonic%20sensors%20work%20by%20emitting,return%20after%20hitting%20an%20object.) and a [post on Arduino's Project Hub](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/MisterBotBreak/how-to-use-an-ultrasonic-sensor-181cee). Originally, I wanted to use the Ardunio Uno to control how the player moved across the screen. Once everything was set up, the noise that played when the character moved layered on top of each other and sounded bad. I finally decided that I wanted the player, for my midterm game, to be able to choose a certain type of difficulty. The amount of difficulty is determined by how close the player is to the Ultrasonic Sensor. To test this part of the project out, I used a flashlight and binderpaper. I moved the flashlight around on the binderpaper to determine how close the object needed to be to the sensor to change the difficulty. When I decided which distances determined the change in difficulty, I drew boxes to remind myself how far the object needed to be from the Ultrasonic Sensor.
