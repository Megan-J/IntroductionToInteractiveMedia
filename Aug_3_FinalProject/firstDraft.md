# Final Project Idea

I want to create a physical robot that is controlled by the Processing window. I have always been interested in robots and the numerous functions they have. I want to create one for my self. The robot could respond to real world actions by incorporating the Ultrasonic sensor and the photoresistor. I thought of incorporating the electronic message board in the SparkFun Inventor's Kit to allow the robot to communicate with the user. The robot would also be able to speak through the piezo buzzer and play different melodies based off it its "feelings." This project would use Arduino to allow the robot to move around and sense objects in its surroundings. Processing would allow the user to control the robot's movements and possibly give the robot an animated face. This is still a rough idea so if you have any thoughts please let me know!
