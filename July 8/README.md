Hello!

The environment in my self-portrait is supposed to be the Muir Woods National Monument in California. Every time I visit I think back to my first time there. The quite peace that settles in the area puts my brain to rest. I stop thinking about everything I have to finish and complete by a certain deadline. I stop planning for the future for a moment and recognize the beauty around me.
