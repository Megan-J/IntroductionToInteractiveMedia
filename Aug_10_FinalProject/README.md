## What I Have So Far

The project is almost completed. So far I have constructed a robot and connected the inputs from the robot into Processing. The Processing window contains an audio visualizer in which people can interact and create their own art piecs based off of inputs from the pre-loaded song, audio inputs, potentiometer, and photoresisoter. My main goal was to create something that resembled an art exhibit and have people be able to create something.


## What's Left?

I want to see if I can change the FFT display to be more artistic within the art piece. I also would like to play with arrays and change some circle's colors or transparency based off of the audio input from the computer's microphone.

## Some Pictures!
